/**
 *  The <tt>Bag</tt> class represents a bag (or multiset) of
 *  generic items. It supports insertion and iterating over the
 *  items in arbitrary order.
 *  <p>
 *
 *  The <em>add</em>, <em>isEmpty</em>, and <em>size</em> operations
 *  take constant time. Iteration takes time proportional to the number of items.
 *  <p>
